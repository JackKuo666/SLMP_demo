Sorokin3,4\\nand Gerard Muyzer1*\\nAbstract\\nBackground: Hypersaline soda lakes are characterized by extreme high soluble carbonate alkalinity. Despite the\\nhigh pH and salt content, highly diverse microbial communities are known to be present in soda lake brines but\\nthe microbiome of soda lake sediments received much less attention of microbiologists. Here, we performed metagenomic\\nsequencing on soda lake sediments to give the first extensive overview of the taxonomic diversity found in these complex,\\nextreme environments and to gain novel physiological insights into the most abundant, uncultured prokaryote lineages.\\nResults: We sequenced five metagenomes obtained from four surface sediments of Siberian soda lakes with a pH 10 and\\na salt content between 70 and 400 g L\\u22121. The recovered 16S rRNA gene sequences were mostly from Bacteria, even in\\nthe salt-saturated lakes. Most OTUs were assigned to uncultured families. We reconstructed 871 metagenome-assembled\\ngenomes (MAGs) spanning more than 45 phyla and discovered the first extremophilic members of the Candidate Phyla\\nRadiation (CPR). Five new species of CPR were among the most dominant community members. Novel dominant\\nlineages were found within previously well-characterized functional groups involved in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen\\ncycling. Moreover, key enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway were encoded within at least four bacterial phyla\\nnever previously associated with this ancient anaerobic pathway for carbon fixation and dissimilation, including the\\nActinobacteria.\\nConclusions: Our first sequencing effort of hypersaline soda lake sediment metagenomes led to two important\\nadvances. First, we showed the existence and obtained the first genomes of haloalkaliphilic members of the CPR\\nand several hundred other novel prokaryote lineages. The soda lake CPR is a functionally diverse group, but the most\\nabundant organisms in this study are likely fermenters with a possible role in primary carbon degradation. Second,\\nwe found evidence for the presence of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in many more taxonomic groups than those\\nencompassing known homo-acetogens, sulfate-reducers, and methanogens. Since only few environmental metagenomics\\nstudies have targeted sediment microbial communities and never to this extent, we expect that our findings are relevant\\nnot only for the understanding of haloalkaline environments but can also be used to set targets for future studies on marine\\nand freshwater sediments.\\nKeywords: Soda lake sediments, Metagenomics, Haloalkaliphilic extremophiles, Candidate Phyla Radiation, Wood-Ljungdahl\\npathway\\n* Correspondence: G.Muijzer@uva.nl\\n\\u2020Adrian-Stefan Andrei and Maliheh Mehrshad contributed equally to this\\nwork.\\n1Microbial Systems Ecology, Department of Freshwater and Marine Ecology,\\nInstitute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, Faculty of Science,\\nUniversity of Amsterdam, Postbus 94248, 1090, GE, Amsterdam, the\\nNetherlands\\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\\n\\u00a9 The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.
