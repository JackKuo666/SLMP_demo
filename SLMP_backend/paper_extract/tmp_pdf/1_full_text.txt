{0: 'RESEARCH\nOpen Access\nA metagenomics roadmap to the\nuncultured genome diversity in hypersaline\nsoda lake sediments\nCharlotte D. Vavourakis1\n, Adrian-Stefan Andrei2†, Maliheh Mehrshad2†, Rohit Ghai2, Dimitry Y. Sorokin3,4\nand Gerard Muyzer1*\nAbstract\nBackground: Hypersaline soda lakes are characterized by extreme high soluble carbonate alkalinity. Despite the\nhigh pH and salt content, highly diverse microbial communities are known to be present in soda lake brines but\nthe microbiome of soda lake sediments received much less attention of microbiologists. Here, we performed metagenomic\nsequencing on soda lake sediments to give the first extensive overview of the taxonomic diversity found in these complex,\nextreme environments and to gain novel physiological insights into the most abundant, uncultured prokaryote lineages.\nResults: We sequenced five metagenomes obtained from four surface sediments of Siberian soda lakes with a pH 10 and\na salt content between 70 and 400 g L−1. The recovered 16S rRNA gene sequences were mostly from Bacteria, even in\nthe salt-saturated lakes. Most OTUs were assigned to uncultured families. We reconstructed 871 metagenome-assembled\ngenomes (MAGs) spanning more than 45 phyla and discovered the first extremophilic members of the Candidate Phyla\nRadiation (CPR). Five new species of CPR were among the most dominant community members. Novel dominant\nlineages were found within previously well-characterized functional groups involved in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen\ncycling. Moreover, key enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway were encoded within at least four bacterial phyla\nnever previously associated with this ancient anaerobic pathway for carbon fixation and dissimilation, including the\nActinobacteria.\nConclusions: Our first sequencing effort of hypersaline soda lake sediment metagenomes led to two important\nadvances. First, we showed the existence and obtained the first genomes of haloalkaliphilic members of the CPR\nand several hundred other novel prokaryote lineages. The soda lake CPR is a functionally diverse group, but the most\nabundant organisms in this study are likely fermenters with a possible role in primary carbon degradation. Second,\nwe found evidence for the presence of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in many more taxonomic groups than those\nencompassing known homo-acetogens, sulfate-reducers, and methanogens. Since only few environmental metagenomics\nstudies have targeted sediment microbial communities and never to this extent, we expect that our findings are relevant\nnot only for the understanding of haloalkaline environments but can also be used to set targets for future studies on marine\nand freshwater sediments.\nKeywords: Soda lake sediments, Metagenomics, Haloalkaliphilic extremophiles, Candidate Phyla Radiation, Wood-Ljungdahl\npathway\n* Correspondence: G.Muijzer@uva.nl\n†Adrian-Stefan Andrei and Maliheh Mehrshad contributed equally to this\nwork.\n1Microbial Systems Ecology, Department of Freshwater and Marine Ecology,\nInstitute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, Faculty of Science,\nUniversity of Amsterdam, Postbus 94248, 1090, GE, Amsterdam, the\nNetherlands\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Microbiome  (2018) 6:168 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-018-0548-7\n', 1: 'Background\nSoda lakes are evaporative, athallasic salt lakes with low cal-\ncium and magnesium concentrations and a high-alkaline\npH up to 11 buffered by dissolved (bi-) carbonate ions [1].\nThey are constrained to arid regions across the globe,\nmainly the tropical East African Rift Valley [2], the Libyan\nDesert [3], the deserts in California and Nevada [4], and the\ndry steppe belt of Central Asia that spans to southern Si-\nberia, north-eastern Mongolia, and Inner Mongolia in\nChina [1]. On top of the extreme salinity and alkaline pH,\nthe Eurasian soda lakes experience extreme seasonal\ntemperature differences, causing highly unstable water re-\ngimes and fluctuating salinities [5]. Yet, soda lakes harbor\ndiverse communities of haloalkaliphilic microbes, mostly\nprokaryotes that are well adapted to survive and grow in\nthese extreme environments and consist of similar func-\ntional groups in soda lakes around the world [1, 2, 6]. The\nrelative abundance of different groups is typically governed\nby the salinity of the brine [1, 7, 8], and microbial-mediated\nnutrient\ncycles\nbecome\npartially\nhampered\nonly\nat\nsalt-saturating conditions [1].\nSo far, all characterized prokaryotic lineages cultured\nfrom soda lakes comprise over 70 different species within\nmore than 30 genera [1, 6, 9, 10]. From these, only a lim-\nited number of genomes have been sequenced today,\nmostly from chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bac-\nteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio (class Gam-\nmaproteobacteria) [1, 11, 12]. It is well established that\nmetagenomics enables the recovery of genomes and the\nidentification of novel genetic diversity where culturing ef-\nforts fail [13, 14]. In recent years, next-generation sequen-\ncing has recovered a massive number of genomes from\npreviously unknown groups of prokaryotes [15, 16],\nincluding a strikingly large and diverse group called\n“Candidate Phyla Radiation” (CPR), only distantly related\nto other cultured bacterial lineages [17]. Previously, we\nconducted a metagenomics study on soda lakes and re-\nconstructed novel genomes from uncultured Bacteroidetes\nand “Candidatus Nanohaloarchaeaota” living in hypersa-\nline Siberian soda brines [7]. Here, we turned our atten-\ntion to the far more complex prokaryotic communities\nliving in the sediments of the hypersaline soda lakes from\nthe same region. We give a broad overview of all the\ntaxonomic groups sequenced and focus on the metabolic\ndiversity found in the reconstructed genomes of the most\nabundant, uncultured organisms.\nResults\nOverall prokaryote community structure\nThe salinities from the studied soda lakes ranged from\nmoderately hypersaline (between 70 and 110 g L−1) to\nsalt-saturated (400 g L−1 salt). The soluble carbonate al-\nkalinity was in the molar range, and the pH in all lakes\nwas around ten (see Additional file 1: Table S1). To give\nan overview of the overall prokaryotic community com-\nposition in each of the samples, we looked at the taxo-\nnomic classification of 16S rRNA genes recovered both\nby amplicon sequencing and direct metagenomics se-\nquencing (Fig. 1, see also Additional file 2: Figure S1;\nAdditional file 3). The prokaryotic communities of all\nfive sediment samples were highly diverse and consisted\nmostly of uncultured taxonomic groups. Bacteria were\nmore abundant than Archaea, regardless of the salinity\nof the overlaying brine [7] (Fig. 1). Euryarchaeota were\nthe second and third largest group in the sediments of\nthe two salt-saturated lakes comprising ~ 10 and ~ 20%\nof the 16S rRNA genes in the metagenomes. Most\nEuryarchaeota-related OTUs detected by amplicon se-\nquencing belonged either to the uncultured Thermoplas-\nmata group KTK 4A (SILVA classification) or the genera\nHalohasta and Halorubrum (class Halobacteria). In ac-\ncordance with cultivation-dependent studies [6], most\nOTUs assigned to methanogens were from the class\nMethanomicrobia,\nespecially\nthe\nlithotrophic\ngenus\nMethanocalculus (up to ~ 3%) and the methylotrophic\ngenus Methanosalsum (Additional file 3).\nThe varying ratio of the three dominant bacterial groups,\nFirmicutes, Bacteroidetes (including the newly proposed\nphyla\nRhodothermaeota\nand\nBalneolaeota\n[18]),\nand\nGammaproteobacteria, showed no clear trend in relation to\nthe salinity in the lakes, but when Firmicutes were domin-\nant, Bacteroidetes were less abundant and vice versa. Most\nFirmicutes belonged to the order Clostridales. Uncultured\nmembers from the family Syntrophomonadaceae had a\nrelative abundance of more than 5% in all five metagen-\nomes and comprised in two lakes even ~ 11–20% of the\nrecovered amplicon sequences. The second most abundant\nFirmicutes order was Halanaerobiales, particularly the\ngenus Halanaerobium (family Halanaerobiaceae) and un-\ncultured members of the Halobacteroidaceae. The majority\nof Bacteroidetes-related OTUs could not be assigned down\nto the genus level. The uncultured ML635J-40 aquatic\ngroup (order Bacteroidales) comprised at least 5% of all five\nprokaryotic communities. This group has been previously\nfound to be abundant in Mono Lake [4] (a soda lake) and\nin an anoxic bioreactor degrading cyanobacterial biomass\nunder haloalkaline conditions [19]. Two other highly abun-\ndant (up to ~ 8%) uncultured groups from the class Balneo-\nlia (proposed new phylum Balneolaeota [18]) were also\ndetected in other soda lakes before [3, 4]. Within the Gam-\nmaproteobacteria, the genus Thioalkalivibrio was abundant\n(~ 3% of the total community), but also uncultured\nmembers of HOC36 were prevailing at moderate salinities.\nMembers of the Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria,\nand Chloroflexi comprised up to ~ 10% of the detected 16S\nrRNA gene in some of the metagenomes. The GIF9 family\nof the class Dehalococcoidia was among the top three most\nabundant OTUs in two lakes. The extremely salt-tolerant\nVavourakis et al.

The\nimportant nitrifying genus Nitrobacter (Alphaproteobacteria)\nwas present in only one of the lakes with moderate salinity\n(Additional file 3).\nSome bacterial top-level taxa appeared less dominant\n(< 5%) from the 16S rRNA genes recovered from the\nmetagenomes but were represented mainly by a single\nhighly abundant OTU in the amplicon sequences, in-\ncluding the haloalkaliphilic genus Truepera within the\nphylum Deinococcus-Thermus, the genus Spirochaeata\nwithin the phylum Spirochaetes, the family BSN166\nwithin the phylum Ignavibacteriae, the BD2–11 terres-\ntrial group within the Gemmatimonadetes, and the\nWCHB1–41\norder\nwithin\nthe\nVerrucomicrobia.\nAll\nOTUs\nwithin\nthe\nThermotogae\nand\nLentisphaerae\nbelonged to uncultured genera from the family Kosmoto-\ngaceae and Oligosphaeraceae, respectively. All Tenericu-\ntes-related OTUs belonged to the class Mollicutes, and\nespecially the order NB1-n was dominant. In contrast,\nthe phylum Planctomycetes was relatively diverse, with\nat least 11 different genus-level OTUs spread over four\nclass-level groups.\nHigh-throughput genome recovery\nWe obtained 717 medium-quality (≥ 50% complete,\n< 10% contamination) and 154 near-complete (≥ 90%\ncomplete, < 5% contamination) metagenome-assembled\ngenomes (MAGs) across three major prokaryote groups:\nArchaea, Bacteria, and CPR (see Additional file 4 and\nAdditional file 2: Figure S2). Figures 2 and 3 show the\ntop-level phylogeny of all MAGs based on 16 ribosomal\nproteins. The reference database used contains a repre-\nsentative for each major prokaryote lineage [17].

Zambryskibacteria” [15] (Fig. 2). The first group of\nMAGs encompassed four different branches in our riboso-\nmal protein tree, suggesting a high-phylogenetic diversity,\nwith 33 putative new species sampled here (ANI and con-\nDNA matrices given in Additional file 6). The “Ca. Zambrys-\nkibacteria-”related MAGs consisted of at least five new\nspecies. Few MAGs were recovered from CPR groups also\ndetected by amplicon sequencing (see Additional file 2:\nFigure S1), namely the “Ca. Dojkabacteria” (former WS6),\n“Ca. Saccharibacteria” (former TM7), CPR2, and “Ca.\nKatanobacteria” (former WWE3).\nFig. 2 Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of the CPR and archaeal MAGs based on 16 ribosomal proteins.

We recovered also one MAG from the\nclass Methanobacteria and a high-quality MAG from the\nWCHA1–57\ngroup\n(“Candidatus\nMethanofastidiosa”\n[22]) in the candidate division WSA2 (Arc I). Several\nMAGs were recovered from the DPANN archaeal\ngroups “Ca. Diapherotrites,” “Ca. Aenigmarchaeota,”\n(see Additional file 2: Figure S3) and “Ca. Woesearch-\naeota” (former Deep Sea Hydrothermal Vent Group 6,\nDHVEG-6). Although we did not reconstruct any\nreasonable-sized MAGs from the TACK superphylum,\nwe found several 16S rRNA genes on the assembled\ncontigs that affiliated to the Thaumarchaeota (see\nAdditional file 1: Table S2).\nNearly every known bacterial phylum had an extremo-\nphilic lineage sampled from our hypersaline soda lake\nsediments (Fig. 3). In most cases, the soda lake lineages\nclearly formed separate branches appearing as sister\ngroups to known reference lineages. The highest genome\nrecovery was from the same top-level taxonomic groups\nthat were also abundant in our 16S rRNA gene analysis.\nFrom the Verrucomicrobia, most MAGs belonged to the\norder WCHB1-41 (16S rRNA gene identity 92–100%).\nHowever, in our ribosomal protein tree, they branched\nwithin the phylum Lentisphaerae.

Microbiome  (2018) 6:168 \nPage 5 of 18\n', 5: 'Several MAGs belonged to the candidate phyla “Ca.\nOmnitrophica,” “Ca. Atribacteria,” and “Ca. Acetother-\nmia” (former OP1), which were moderately abundant\nalso in some sediment (see Additional file 2: Figure S1).\nFor the latter phylum, we suspect that four MAGs were\nmore closely related to ca. div. WS1 and “Ca. Lindow-\nbacteria” for which only few reference genomes are\ncurrently available in NCBI (see Additional file 2:\nFigure S4). Due to a high-sequencing coverage, we also\nmanaged to reconstruct several MAGs from rare Bacteria\n(< 100 amplicon sequences detected, see Additional file 2:\nFigure S1), including the phyla “Ca. Hydrogenedentes,”\n“Ca. Cloacimonetes,” ca. div. BRC1, Elusimicrobia, Caldi-\nserica, and “Ca. Latescibacteria.” The MAGs from the\nlatter phylum were more closely related to the recently\nproposed phylum “Ca. Handelsmanbacteria” [15]. Two\nadditional MAGs with 16S rRNA gene fragments with\n94–95% identity to the class MD2898-B26 (Nitrospinae)\nwere more likely members of ca. div. KSB3 (proposed\n“Ca. Moduliflexus” [24], see Additional file 2: Figure S5).\nDraft genomes of haloalkaliphilic CPR\nStrikingly, members of the CPR related to “Ca. Nealson-\nbacteria” and “Ca. Vogelbacteria” were among the top\n5% of abundant organisms in the surface sediments of\nthe soda lakes, especially those with moderate salinity\n(Fig. 4). Like most members of the CPR, the MAGs of\nthe four most abundant “Ca. Nealsonbacteria” seem to\nbe anaerobic fermenters [25]. They lacked a complete\nTCA cycle and most complexes from the oxidative elec-\ntron transfer chain, except for the subunit F of a\nNADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I, nuoF, nuoG,\nnuoA) and coxB genes (complex II). All CPR MAGs had\na near-complete glycolysis pathway (Embden-Meyerhof-\nParnas) encoded, but pentose phosphate pathways were\nseverely truncated. The commonly encoded F- and\nV-type ATPase can establish a membrane potential for\nsymporter-antiporters by utilizing the ATP formed by\nsubstrate-level phosphorylation during fermentation. All\nCPR have V-type ATPases that can translocate Na+ in\naddition to H+ (see Additional file 2: Figure S6), while\nonly two members of the “Ca. Falkowbacteria” had puta-\ntive Na+-coupled F-type ATPases (see Additional file 2:\nFigure S7). The coupling of ATP hydrolysis to sodium\ntranslocation is advantageous to maintain pH homeosta-\nsis in alkaline environments. Interestingly, with only two\nexceptions [26, 27], all CPR genomes recovered from\nother environments with neutral pH were reported to\nencode only F-type ATPases [28–32]. One low-abundant\nMAG affiliated to “Ca. Peregrinibacteria” contained both\nthe\nlarge\nsubunit\nof\na\nRuBisCO\n(type\nII/III,\nsee\nAdditional file 2: Figure S8) and a putative phosphoribu-\nlokinase (PRK, K00855) encoded in the same contig.\nThis is remarkable because PRK homologs were not\npreviously identified among CPR, and RuBisCo form II/\nIII was inferred to function in a nucleoside salvage path-\nway [33]. One “Ca. Saccharibacteria” MAG encoded for\na putative channelrhodopsin (see Additional file 2:\nFigure S9). This is the first rhodopsin found among the\nCPR and suggests that this enigmatic group of organ-\nisms may have acquired evolutionary adaptations to a\nlife in sunlit surface environments.\nA previous study showed that most CPR has coccoid\ncell morphotypes with a monoderm cell envelope resem-\nbling those from Gram-positives and Archaea but with a\ndistinct S-layer [34]. Thick peptidoglycans coated with\nacidic surface polymers such as teichoic acids help pro-\ntect the cells of Gram-positives against reactive hydroxyl\nions in highly alkaline environments [35] (Fig. 5a). All\nsoda lake CPR had indeed the capability for peptidogly-\ncan biosynthesis, but we found proteins typical for\nGram-negatives for the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccha-\nrides (see Additional file 1: Table S3), homologous to the\ninner membrane proteins of type II secretion systems\nand\nto\nseveral\nproteins\nassociated\nto\nthe\nouter\nmembrane and peptidoglycan, including OmpA.\nIt remains to be determined whether the soda lake\nCPR also lacks an outer membrane and perhaps anchor\nlipopolysaccharides, S-layer proteins, and lipoproteins to\nthe inner cell membrane or peptidoglycan. We also\nfound gene encoding cardiolipin and squalene synthases.\nIncreased levels of cardiolipin and the presence of squa-\nlene make the cytoplasmic membrane less leaky for\nprotons [36]. In addition, cation/proton exchangers are\nknown to play a crucial role for pH homeostasis in alka-\nliphilic prokaryotes as they help acidify the cytoplasm\nduring the extrusion of cations [35]. Putative Na+/H+\nexchangers of the Nha-type and multi-subunit Mnh-type\nwere found only within a few soda lake CPR. Secondary\nactive transport of K+ might be mediated in most soda\nlake CPR by KefB (COG0475)/kch Kef-type, glutathione-\ndependent K+ transport systems, with or without H+\nantiport (67,68).\nVarious soda lake CPR had an acidic proteome, with\npI curves resembling those found in extremely halophilic\nBacteria. Intracellular proteins enriched in acidic amino\nacids might be an adaptation to a “salt-in” strategy, i.e.,\nmaintaining high intracellular potassium (K+) concentra-\ntions to keep osmotic balance [7, 37] (Fig. 5b; see\nAdditional file 2: Figure S10). Such a strategy is energet-\nically favorable over de novo synthesis or import of\nosmolytes such as ectoine and glycine betaine. We did\nnot find genes for the synthesis of organic osmolytes and\nhomologs of ABC-type transporters for primary active\nuptake of proline/glycine betaine which were encoded\nonly in one MAG (Fig. 5a). For the “Ca. Nealsonbac-\nteria” and “Ca. Vogelbacteria,” the salt-in strategy might\nbe a unique feature for the soda lake species explaining\nVavourakis et al.

Finally,\nmechanosensitive ion channels (mscS, mscL) and ABC-\ntype multidrug transport systems (AcrAB, ccmA, EmrA,\nMdlB, NorM) and sodium efflux permeases (NatB) were\nencoded in almost every MAG. The first might rapidly\nrestore the turgor pressure under fluctuating salinity\nconditions by releasing cytoplasmic ions [38].\nNovel abundant groups involved in sulfur, nitrogen, and\ncarbon cycles\nA new species of Thioalkalivibrio (family Ectothiorhodospir-\naceae) was by far the most abundant in the sediments of\nthe two salt-saturated lakes (Fig. 4). In the sediment of\nBitter-1, also a purple sulfur bacterium from the same fam-\nily was highly abundant. It was closely related to Halorho-\ndospira, a genus also frequently cultured from hypersaline\nsoda lakes [1]. None of the abundant Ectothiorhodospira-\nceae spp. had already a species-representative genome\nsequenced (Additional file 6). The potential of the Thioalk-\nalivibrio spp. for chemolithotrophic sulfur oxidation was\nevident (Additional file 7; see Additional file 8: Information\nS1). Interestingly, the encoded nitrogen metabolisms were\nquite versatile. While Thioalkalivibrio sp. 1 had the poten-\ntial for nitrate reduction to nitrite, Thioalkalivibrio sp. 2\nmight perform dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonia\n(DNRA; see Additional file 2: Figure S12).\nTwo\ndeltaproteobacterial\nlineages\nof\ndissimilatory\nsulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were highly abundant in\nthe soda lake sediment of Bitter-1. One MAG from the\nfamily Desulfobacteraceae (order Desulfobacterales) is\nthe first genome from the genus Desulfonatronobacter. It\nencodes the genes for complete sulfate reduction to sul-\nfide using various electron donors, as well as for the\ncomplete oxidation of volatile fatty acids and alcohols, a\nunique\nfeature\nfor\nthe\ngenus\nDesulfonatronobacter\namong haloalkaliphilic SRB [10] (see Additional file 8:\nInformation S2). Fumarate and nitrite (DNRA, NrfAH)\ncould be used as alternative electron acceptors. The sec-\nond dominant lineage was a new species from the genus\nDesulfonatronospira (family Desulfohalobiaceae, order\nDesulfovibrionales). Like other members of this genus, it\nhad the potential to reduce or disproportionate partially\nreduced sulfur compounds. In addition, it could also use\nnitrite as an alternative electron acceptor (NrfAH) [6].\nA novel lineage of gammaproteobacterial SOB was\nhighly abundant in the sediments of the moderately hy-\npersaline Cock Soda Lake. It appeared as a sister group of\nthe family Xanthomonadaceae in the ribosomal protein\ntree. This heterotrophic organism could conserve energy\nthrough aerobic respiration. It might detoxify sulfide by\noxidizing it to elemental sulfur (sqr) with subsequent re-\nduction or disproportionation of the polysulfides (psrA)\nchemically formed from the sulfur. It also encoded the po-\ntential for DNRA (nrfA and napC). Genes likely involved\nin sulfide detoxification (sqr and psrA) were found also in\nseveral other abundant MAGs of heterotrophs, including\none new abundant species from the family of Nitrilirup-\ntoraceae (class Nitriliruptoria, phylum Actinobacteria).\nWe found a wide variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes\nin these MAGs, such as cellulases (GH1 family) in\naddition to genes for glycolysis and TCA cycle and a\nchlorophyll/bacteriochlorophyll a/b synthase (bchG gene).\nThe latter was also found in other Actinobacteria from the\ngenus Rubrobacter [39]. No evidence was found for\nnitrile-degrading potential.\nA second novel, uncultured lineage of Gammaproteo-\nbacteria that was highly abundant at moderate salinities\nbranched in our ribosomal protein tree as a sister group\nto the family Halothiobacillaceae. The MAGs encoded\nfor a versatile metabolism typical for purple non-sulfur\nbacteria. The MAGs contained puf genes, bch genes,\ngenes for carotenoid biosynthesis (not shown), and a\nCalvin cycle for photoautotrophic growth. Alternatively,\nenergy may be conserved through aerobic respiration,\nwhile acetate and proprionate could be taken up via an\nacetate permease (actP) and further used for acetyl-CoA\nbiosynthesis and carbon assimilation. Since the sqr gene\nwas present, but no dsr or sox genes, the organism\nmight oxidize sulfide only to elemental sulfur. One bin\ncontained also nifDKH genes suggesting putative diazo-\ntrophy, as well as a coenzyme F420 hydrogenase suggest-\ning photoproduction of hydrogen [40].\nThe abundant Euryarchaeota organism showed a clear\npreference for higher salinities. We obtained one highly\nabundant MAG from the class Thermoplasmata that\nencoded a full-length 16S rRNA gene only distantly re-\nlated (91,2% identity, e value 0) to that of a member of\nthe KTK 4A group found in a hypersaline endoevaporitic\nmicrobial mat [8].

The KTK 4A\nmight be also primary degraders since they encoded pu-\ntative cellulases (CAZY-families GH1, GH5) and chiti-\nnases (GH18). Interestingly, half of the MAGs encoded a\nputative\nchlorophyll/bacteriochlorophyll\na/b\nsynthase\n(bchG), which is highly unusual for Archaea. Although\nlittle can be inferred from the presence of only one\nmarker gene, a functional bchG was previously also\nfound in Crenarchaeota [41]. The remaining two highly\nabundant Euryarchaeota-related MAGs belonged to a\nnew species of Halorubrum (Additional file 6).\nKey genes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway found in\nnovel phylogenetic groups\nMore than 50 MAGs were related to the family Syntro-\nphomonadaceae (class Clostridia, phylum Firmicutes)\nbased on ribosomal protein phylogeny. All 16S rRNA\ngene sequences found in the MAGS had 86–95% iden-\ntity to sequences obtained from uncultured organisms\nrelated to the genus Dethiobacter. While an isolated\nstrain of Dethiobacter alkaliphilus is a facultative auto-\ntroph\nthat\nrespires\nthiosulfate,\nelemental\nsulfur\nor\npolysulfides with hydrogen as an electron donor [42] or\ndisproportionates\nsulfur\n[43],\nother\nhaloalkaliphilic\nmembers\nof\nthe\nSyntrophomonadaceae\nare\nreverse\nacetogens, oxidizing acetate in syntrophy with a hydro-\ngenotrophic partner [44]. Two populations (different\nspecies, Additional file 6) were especially abundant in\nCock Soda Lake (Fig. 4). They encoded for a full\nCODH/ACS complex, the key enzyme for the reductive\nacetyl-CoA or Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WL) and a\ncomplete\nEastern\nbranch\nfor\nCO2\nconversion\nto\n5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (Additional file 9) [45, 46].\nAcetogens use the WL to reduce CO2 to acetyl-CoA,\nwhich can be fixed into the cell or used to conserve en-\nergy via acetogenesis. Syntrophic acetate oxidizers, some\nsulfate reducing bacteria and aceticlastic methanogens\nrun the WL in reverse. Syntrophomonadaceae sp. 2\nencoded for a putative thiosulfate/polysulfide reductase\nas well as a phosphotransacetylase (pta) and an acetate\nkinase (ack) for the ATP-dependent conversion of acet-\nate to acetyl-CoA. Although alternative pathways for the\nlatter interconversion can exist, this second species has\nthe complete potential for (reversed) acetogenesis.\nHighly remarkable was the presence of a bacterial-type\nCODH/ACS\ncomplex\nand\na\nnear-complete\neastern\nbranch of the WL in a highly abundant species in Cock\nSoda Lake from the family Coriobacteriaceae (phylum\nActinobacteria). This prompted us to scan all 871 MAGs\nfor the presence of acsB encoding for the beta-subunit\nof the oxido-reductase module of CODH/ACS. We con-\nfirmed an encoded\n(near)-complete\nWL in several\nadditional organisms belonging to phylogenetic groups\nnot\npreviously\nassociated\nwith\nthis\npathway\n[46]\n(Additional file 9). We removed the Coriobacteriaceae\nacsB genes from the final dataset to construct a phylo-\ngenetic tree since they were < 500 aa (Fig. 6) but found\nseven MAGs from the OPB41 class within the Actino-\nbacteria (16S rRNA gene fragment identity 94–96%).\nThe eastern branch of WL can function independently\nin folate-dependent C1 metabolism [45], but the pres-\nence of the Western-branch in a phylum that comprises\nmostly aerobic isolates is very surprising. The WL in\ncombination with the potential for acetate to acetyl-CoA\ninterconversion (pta/ack) and a glycolysis pathway were\nalso present in the soda lake MAGs from the phyla “Ca.\nHandelsmanbacteria,” “Ca. Atribacteria” (latter branched\nwithin the “Ca. Acetothermia”), and the class LD1-PA32\n(Chlamydiae), suggesting all these uncultured organisms\nmight be heterotrophic acetogens. However, it should be\nnoted that a PFOR typically connecting glycolysis to the\nWL was only encoded in the LD1-PA32 MAGs. More-\nover, from the genetic make-up alone, it cannot be\nexcluded that acetate is activated, and the WL run in\nreverse for syntrophic acetate oxidation. Finally, the\nnovel acsB genes from soda lake Halanaerobiaceae,\nNatranaerobiaceae, and Halobacteroidaceae (Firmicutes)\nand from Brocadiaceae and Planctomycetaceae (Plancto-\nmycetes) disrupt the previously proposed dichotomy\nbetween Terrabacteria and Gracilicutes bacterial groups\nunifying 16S rRNA and acsB gene phylogenies [46] and\nsuggest a far more complex evolutionary history of the\nWL pathway than previously anticipated.\nDiscussion\nExtensive\nclassical\nmicrobiology\nefforts\nhave\nbeen\nalready undertaken to explore the unique extremophilic\nmicrobial communities inhabiting soda lakes. These un-\ncovered the presence of most of the functional groups\nparticipating in carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and minor\nelement cycling at haloalkaline conditions. The main re-\nsults of this work are summarized in several recent re-\nviews [1, 6, 47, 48]. Since most microbes, including\nthose living in soda lakes, still evade all cultivation ef-\nforts, a very effective way to discover new microbes and\nassess their physiology based on their genetic repertoire\nis either through single cell genomics or by directly se-\nquenced environmental DNA. This exploratory metage-\nnomics\nstudy\nperformed\non\nsoda\nlake\nsediments\neffectively overcame the existing cultivation bottleneck.\nFirst, we expanded the known diversity of CPR consider-\nably with the first genomes of poly-extremophiles sam-\npled from soda lake sediments. Although the presence of\n16S rRNA genes from CPR in marine sediments and hy-\npersaline microbial mats was previously shown [34],\nuntil now, CPR MAGs were mainly obtained from deep,\nsubsurface environments [15, 26, 29, 32, 49–52], and hu-\nman microbiota [30].

Microbiome  (2018) 6:168 \nPage 11 of 18\n', 11: 'here, CPR went unnoticed in previous amplicon sequen-\ncing studies. This might be due to the fact that many\nCPR representatives have random inserts of various\nlength in their 16S rRNA genes or due to primer mis-\nmatches [29, 34]. This illustrates also that direct metage-\nnomics should not only be preferred over amplicon\nsequencing to infer functional potential, but the former\nis far more effective for the discovery of novel organ-\nisms. Second, we obtained many more genomes from\n“traditional” bacterial phyla such as the Planctomycetes\nand Chloroflexi, as well as candidate phyla, for which no\nsoda lake isolates, hence no genomes were previously\nobtained. Third, even within the sulfur cycle, the most\nactive and frequently studied element cycle in soda lakes\n[1], we found considerable metabolic novelty. Finally, we\nfound the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in several novel\nphyla, not closely related to any known acetogens,\nmethanogens, or sulfate-reducing bacteria [46]. The lat-\nter shows that our sequencing recovery effort has also\nsignificantly contributed to the discovery of metabolic\nnovelty within various prokaryote phylogenetic groups.\nSalinity is often considered to be the major factor\nshaping prokaryote community composition in diverse\nhabitats [53, 54]. Extreme halophilic Euryarchaeota\nseem to be always the dominant group in salt-saturated\nhypersaline brines, both those with neutral or alkaline\npH [1, 7, 37]. Here, we found that although these\nhaloarchaea are still relatively more abundant in the sed-\niments exposed to brines with salt-saturating conditions,\nthe clear majority of microbes in all investigated hyper-\nsaline soda lake sediments are Bacteria. It could be\nhypothesized that the sediment is a hide-out for the\nextreme alkalinity and salinity governing the water\ncolumn, and that sediment stratification, especially in\nthe anoxic part, offers plenty of opportunities for niche\ndiversification. On the other hand, it should no longer\nbe a surprise that soda lakes are such productive and\nbiodiverse\nsystems.\nFirst,\nit\nhas\nbeen\npreviously\nelaborated that soda lake organisms are exposed to\napproximately half the osmotic pressure in sodium\ncarbonate-dominated\nbrines\ncompared\nto\nsodium\nchloride-dominated brines with the same Na+ molarity\n[47]. Second, nitrogen limitation in the community can\nbe overcome when many members contribute to the\nfixation of atmospheric N2, and various forms of organic\nnitrogen are efficiently recycled. The soda lakes exam-\nined in this study were also eutrophic, and sulfur com-\npounds were abundant. Sulfide is also far less toxic at\nhigh pH as it mostly occurs in the form of bisulfide\n(HS−). Besides the evident high metabolic and taxo-\nnomic diversity of dissimilatory sulfur-cycling bacteria, a\ndiverse heterotrophic community can be sustained com-\nprising both generalist and very specialized carbon de-\ngraders. Less eutrophic soda lakes might not suffer from\ncarbon\nlimitation\neither,\ndue\nto\na\npresence\nof\nhigh-bicarbonate concentrations. These effectively elim-\ninate the inorganic carbon limitation for primary pro-\nducers who are highly active in soda lakes, especially\nCyanobacteria [55, 56]. Third, light that penetrates the\nsurface of the sediment seems to stimulate oxygenic and\nanoxygenic phototrophic growth. Moreover, various het-\nerotrophs, such as the rhodopsin-containing haloarchaea\nand Bacteroidetes, have the option to tap into this un-\nlimited energy source for example to help sustain the\ncostly maintenance of osmotic balance. Unexpectedly,\nwe even found the first rhodopsin encoded by a member\nof the CPR. Fourth, tight syntrophic relations, as pro-\nposed for CPR members and Syntrophomonadaceae\nspp., might be the solution to successful growth in an\nenergetically challenging environment.\nSince our metagenomes are snapshots in time and space,\nthe failure to reconstruct specific MAGs gives no conclu-\nsive evidence for the absence of certain microbial-mediated\nelement transformation in hypersaline soda lake sediments.\nAdditionally, technical limitations of the assembly and bin-\nning of highly micro-diverse genome populations might\nhamper genome recovery [57]. More importantly, the\nabundance of a specific microbe is not necessarily corre-\nlated to the importance of its performance in an ecosystem.\nMany metabolic capacities are redundant, and often key\ntransformations are reserved for a few rare organisms that\nmight proliferate for a short time-span when specific condi-\ntions allow for it. For example, although no MAGs were re-\ncovered from chemolithoautotrophic nitrifiers [58], we did\ndetect a Nitrobacter-related OTU by amplicon sequencing\nand assembled 16S rRNA genes from Thaumarchaeota,\nsuggesting bacterial and archaeal nitrifiers are present in\nthe surface sediments of soda lakes at very low abundance.\nFinally, the method of DNA isolation might impact the\ncommunity composition apparent in the final metagenome\nsequenced. Environmental samples contain complex mix-\ntures of different organisms, and it is impossible to find a\nprotocol where the DNA from every single organism is ex-\ntracted as efficiently without compromising the final quality\nof the extracted DNA. However, since we find all the im-\nportant taxonomic and functional groups known from pre-\nvious cultivation-dependent studies back in either our\namplicon sequencing datasets or our directly sequenced\nmetagenomes, we are confident that the community com-\nposition and the MAGs presented here are representative\nfor the microbiomes of the soda lake sediments in the\nKulunda Steppe.\nConclusion\nYears of intensive microbiological research on soda lakes\nseem to have paid off, since many of the described gen-\nera we could detect here have a cultured representative\nfrom soda lakes. However, as many of the abundant\nVavourakis et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:168 \nPage 12 of 18\n', 12: 'lineages and groups found in soda lake sediments are\nstill uncultured, metagenomics proved to be a helpful\ntool to gain primary insights in the potential physiology\nand ecology of these poly-extremophilic prokaryotes.\nWe reconstructed the first genomes for many of such\norganisms and proposed new functional roles for the\nmost abundant ones. Future studies should provide\nmore in depth analyses of these genomes, especially\nfrom the less abundant organisms that might perform\nkey ecological processes, such as methanogens and nitri-\nfiers. In addition, they should focus on gaining physio-\nlogical culture-based evidence or proof for in situ\nactivity for the abundant organisms described here. The\nkey metabolic insights provided by this metagenomics\nstudy can lead to the design of new cultivation strategies.\nIn general, sediment communities are far more complex\nthan those found in the corresponding water column\n[53, 59] and are therefore often considered too complex\nfor efficient metagenomic analysis. Many of the novel\nlineages found here may therefore have related neutro-\nphilic lineages in marine and freshwater sediments that\nawait discovery. We demonstrate here that, by providing\nsufficient sequencing depth, the “state of the art metage-\nnomics toolbox” can effectively be used on sediments as\nwell.\nMethods\nSite description and sample collection\nThe top 10 cm sediments from four hypersaline, eutrophic\nsoda lakes located in the Kulunda Steppe (south-western\nSiberia, Altai, Russia) were sampled in July of 2010 and\n2011. General features and exact location of the sampled\nsoda lakes are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1; a\nmap of the area was published previously [5]. Cock Soda\nLake (a stand-alone lake, sampled both in 2010 and 2011)\nand Tanatar-3 (Tanatar system) were moderately hypersa-\nline (~ 100 g L−1) with sandy sediment, while Tanatar-1\nand Bitter-1 (Bitter system) were salt-saturated (400 g L−1)\nwith sulfide-rich sapropel sediments underlined by rock\ntrona deposits [7, 60]. Especially, Bitter-1 harbors a very\nactive microbial community, probably due to its high-\norganic and -mineral content. Surface sediments were col-\nlected by a plastic corer into sterile glass containers and\ntransported to the laboratory in a cooler.\nDNA isolation, 16S rRNA amplicon, and metagenomic\nsequencing\nThe colloidal fraction of each sediment sample (~ 10%\nof 50 g) was separated from the course sandy fraction by\nseveral short (30–60 s) low-speed (1–2,000 rpm in\n50 mL Falcon tubes) centrifugation steps and washed\nwith 1–2 M NaCl solution. The pelleted colloidal sedi-\nment fraction was first subjected to 3 cycles of freezing\nin liquid nitrogen/thawing, then re-suspended in 0.1 M\nTris (pH 8)/10 mM EDTA, and then subjected to harsh\nbead beating treatment. Next, the samples were incu-\nbated with lysozyme (15 mg/mL) for 2 h at 37 °C\nfollowed by a SDS (10% w/v) and proteinase K (10 μg/\nmL) treatment for 30 min. at 45 °C. High molecular\nweight DNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform ex-\ntraction, quality-checked, and sequenced as described\npreviously [7]. Direct high-throughput sequencing of the\nDNA was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 plat-\nform to generate 150 b paired-end reads. Amplification\nof the V4-V6 region of prokaryote 16S rRNA genes\nusing barcoded 926F-1392R primers, amplicon purifica-\ntion, quantification, and Roche (454)-sequencing was\nperformed together in a batch with brine samples from\nthe same sampling campaigns. Barcodes and adapter se-\nquences were removed from de-multiplexed amplicon\nsequence reads and analyzed with the automated NGS\nanalysis pipeline of the SILVA rRNA gene database pro-\nject [61] (SILVAngs 1.3, database release version 128)\nusing default parameters. The OTUs (97% identity)\nassigned down to the genus level were only considered\nwhen they had a relative abundance ≥ 0.1% in at least\none of the five datasets.\nProcessing metagenomics reads, assembly, binning, and\npost-binning\nMetagenomic raw reads were quality trimmed using\nSickle [62] (version 1.33), and only reads ≥ 21 b were\nretained. The prokaryotic community structure at taxo-\nnomic top levels was extrapolated from ten million ran-\ndomly sampled singletons from each dataset. Candidate\n16S rRNA fragments > 90 b were identified [63] and\ncompared against the SILVA SSU database 128 (blastn,\nmin. length 90, min. identity 80%, e value 1e-5). To ver-\nify that the microbial community composition was in-\ndeed\nmostly\nprokaryotic,\nwe\ndid\na\nmore\ngeneral\nscreening of the metagenomics reads that identified also\ncandidate 18S rRNA fragments > 90 b (see Additional\nfile 1: Tables S4-S5). The complete trimmed read sets\nwere assembled into contigs ≥ 1 kb with MEGAHIT [64]\n(v1.0.3–6-gc3983f9) using paired-end mode, k min = 21,\nk max = 131, k step = 10. Genes were predicted using\nProdigal [65] (v.2.6.2) and RNAs with rna_hmm3 [66]\nand tRNAscan-SE [67]. Assembled 16S rRNA sequences\nwere compared to a manually curated version from the\nSILVA SSU database (e value ≥ 1e-5). Predicted protein\nsequences\nwere\nannotated\nagainst\nKEGG\nwith\nGhostKOALA (genus_prokaryotes + family_eukaryotes\n+ viruses) [68]. Marker genes for central metabolic\npathways and key environmental element transforma-\ntions were identified based on K number assignments\n[15, 69–71].\nContigs ≥ 2.5 kb were binned with METABAT [72]\n(superspecific mode) based on differential coverage\nVavourakis et al. Microbiome  (2018) 6:168 \nPage 13 of 18\n', 13: 'values obtained by mapping all five trimmed readsets to\nall five contig sets with Bowtie2 [73]. The bins were sub-\njected to post-binning (an overview of the workflow is\ngiven in Additional file 2: Figure S13). Bins were\nassessed with lineage-specific single copy genes using\nCheckM [74] and further processed with the metage-\nnomics workflow in Anvi’o [75] (v2.3.2). Since Candidate\nPhyla Radiant (CPR) is not included in the CheckM ref-\nerence trees and are likely to have low-genome com-\npleteness, we used an existing training file of 797 CPR\ngenomes to identify putative CPR bins [76]. Bins with\nCheckM-completeness ≥ 50% (884 out of 1778) and an\nadditional four CPR bins were further processed. Coding\nsequences\nwere\nannotated\nfor\ntaxonomy\nagainst\nNCBI-nr (July, 2017) with USEARCH [77] (5.2.32) to\nverify that most hits in each bin were to prokaryotic ref-\nerences. Phage or viral contigs were manually removed.\nGenome\ncontamination (redundancy)\nwas estimated\nbased on marker sets of universal single copy genes\nidentified for Bacteria [30] and Archaea [78] as imple-\nmented in Anvi’o. Genome coverage was obtained by\nmapping trimmed reads with BBMap [79] v36.x (kfilter\n31, subfilter 15, maxindel 80). Bins with ≥ 5% redun-\ndancy were further refined with Anvi’o using circle phy-\nlograms\n(guide\ntrees\ntnf-cov:\neuclidian\nward)\nand\nscanned again for CPR. Post-binning resulted in a total\nof 2499 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), of\nwhich 871 were either medium-quality genome drafts\n(CheckM estimated completeness ≥ 50% and contamin-\nation ≤ 10% [80], Additional file 4) or lower quality draft\ngenomes from CPR.\nPhylogeny of the MAGs was assessed based on 16\nsingle-copy ribosomal proteins and representative refer-\nence genomes of major prokaryote lineages across the\ntree of life [17]. Individual ribosomal proteins in our\nMAGs were identified by K number assignments. Only\nribosomal proteins ≥ 80 aa were considered. Initial\nmaximum-likelihood (ML) trees were constructed to de-\ntermine which organisms belonged to the Archaea, Bac-\nteria, or CPR with FastTree 2 [81] (WAG + CAT). Final\nseparate trees for the three distant evolutionary groups\nwere constructed in the same manner. Each ribosomal\nprotein set was aligned separately with MAFFT [82]\n(v7.055b, − auto) and concatenated only if a MAG\nencoded at least 8 out of 16 proteins. For all trees, a\n100× posterior bootstraps\nanalysis\nwas\nperformed.\nPhylogenetic trees were visualized together with gen-\nome statistics and abundance information using iTOL\n[83]. We cross-checked the taxonomic assignments\nbased on the phylogeny of the ribosomal protein cas-\nsette\nwith\nthe\ntop\nhit\ncontig annotations\nagainst\nNCBI-nr and with the reference lineage obtained with\nCheckM. Lastly, we manually corrected the MAGs for\nmisplaced 16S rRNA genes. The final trees presented\nin the manuscript were redrawn using FigTree v1.4.3\n[84].\nDetailed genome analyses\nCPR\nMAGs\nwere\nre-annotated\nmore\nthoroughly:\ngenes were predicted with Prokka [85], and functional\npredictions were performed by running InterProScan\n5 locally on the supplied COG, CDD, TIGRFAMs,\nHAMAP, Pfam, and SMART databases [86]. BLAST\nKoala was used for KEGG pathway predictions [68].\nTo find putative carbohydrate-active enzymes in all\nfinal MAGs, we used the web-resource dbCAN [87]\nto annotate all predicted proteins ≥ 80 aa against\nCAZy [88].\nTo identify the top ten abundant MAGs from each re-\nspective dataset, ten million randomly sampled single-\ntons were mapped onto each MAG with a cut-off of 95%\nidentity in minimum of 50 bases. Coverage values were\nadditionally normalized for genome size and expressed\nas reads per kilobase of sequence per gigabase of\nmapped reads (RPKG) [89]. A positive score (from 871\nto 1) was assigned to each MAG according to the rank-\ning of the summed RPKG of MAGs in the high-salinity\ndatasets (B1Sed10 and T1Sed) and a negative score ac-\ncording to the ranking of the summed RPKGs in the\nmoderate salinity datasets (CSSed10, CSSed11, T3Se\nd10). Both scores were summed to get a “salinity prefer-\nence score” with MAGs recruiting preferably from high\nsalinity datasets on the positive end, moderate salinity\ndatasets in the negative end, and those without prefer-\nence in the middle.\nWe determined species delineation for the most\nabundant MAGs and their closest reference genomes\n(NCBI-nr) by Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and\nconserved DNA-matrices, as follows [90]: ANI ≥ 95%,\nconDNA ≥ 69% = same species, ANI ≥ 95%, condDNA\n< 69% = might be same species, ANI < 95%, condDNA\n< 69% = different species. Single gene trees based on\nmaximum\nlikelihood\nwere\nconstructed\nwith\nun-\ntrimmed alignments (MAFFT, L-INS-i model) and\nFastTree 2 (WAG + CAT, increased accuracy, -spr4\n-mlacc 2 -slownni) using 100× bootstraps.

All submitted\nversions described in this paper are version XXXX01000000. Size =\nrecovered genome size, Completeness (Compl1), contamination (Cont),\nstrain heterogenity (Str het) and Taxon CheckM were inferred from\nlineage-specific marker sets and a reference tree build with CheckM [74].\nAdditional completeness (compl2) and redundancy (red) estimates were\ninferred based on the presence of universal single copy genes for Bacteria\nand Archaea [75]. Decision and confidence intervals from the Candidate\nPhyla Radiation (CPR) scan [75] are given, as well as the taxonomy of the\nbesthit in SILVA when 16S rRNA genes were present. Phylum/class 16\nribosomal proteins is the taxonomy derived from our ribosomal protein\ntrees (see main text: Figs. 2 and 3).
